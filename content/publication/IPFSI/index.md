abstract: "Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify the relationship between isometric force production symmetry and jumping performance in weighted and un-weighted static and countermovement jumps (SJ and CMJ). Design: Bivariate correlation between isometric force production symmetry and vertical jump performance variables. Methods: Collegiate athletes were evaluated for this study (n=36). Subjects performed SJ, CMJ, and isometric mid-thigh pulls (IMTP). Jumps were analyzed for jump height (JH) and peak power (PP). IMTP was analyzed for peak force (PF) for left and right sides, and values were calculated to produce a peak force symmetry index (PF-SI) score. Correlational statistics were performed examining the relationship between PF-SI and jump variables. Results: Moderate statistically significant negative correlations were observed between PF-SI and all jump variables, indicating that as asymmetry increases jump performance decreases. SJ correlations weakened in weighted conditions (JH r=-0.52 @ 0 kg/r=-0.39 @ 20 kg, PP r=-0.43 @ 0 kg/r=-0.34 @ 20 kg), but CMJ produced similar correlations for both conditions (JH r=-0.47 @ 0 kg/r=-0.49 @ 20 kg, PP r=-0.28 @ 0 kg/r=-0.34 @ 20 kg). Unlike the SJ, which only contains the propulsive or concentric portion of the jump, the CMJ also contains the eccentric portion and performance contributions of the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). The addition of the SSC may play a role in the maintaining the magnitude of asymmetry in the CMJ weighted condition. Conclusions: The results indicate that force production asymmetry may be detrimental to bilateral vertical jumping performance. The findings should be considered for further investigation on sport-specific tasks."
