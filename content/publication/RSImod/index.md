abstract: "The purposes of this study included examining the reliability of reactive strength index-modified (RSImod), the relationships between RSImod and force-time variables, and the differences in RSImod between male and female collegiate athletes. 106 Division I collegiate athletes performed unloaded and loaded countermovement jumps. Intraclass correlation coefficients and typical error expressed as a coefficient of variation were used to establish the relative and absolute reliability of RSImod, respectively. Pearson zero order product-moment correlation coefficients were used to examine the relationships between RSImod and rate of force development, peak force, and peak power during unloaded and loaded jumping conditions. Finally, independent samples t-tests were used to examine the sex differences in RSImod between male and female athletes. Intraclass correlation coefficient values for RSImod ranged 0.96 – 0.98 and typical error values ranged 7.5 – 9.3% during all jumping conditions. Statistically significant correlations existed between RSImod and all force-time variables examined for male and female athletes during both jumping conditions (p < 0.05). Statistically significant differences in RSImod existed between males and females during both unloaded and loaded CMJs (p < 0.001). RSImod appears to be a reliable performance measurement in male and female athletes. RSImod may be described and used as a measure of explosiveness. Stronger relationships between RSImod, peak force, and peak power existed in female athletes as compared to male athletes; however, further evidence investigating these relationships is needed before conclusive statements can be made. Male athletes produced greater RSImod values as compared to female athletes."
