abstract: "We are pleased to see the recent surge in empirical and applied research efforts toward elucidating best practices in monitoring athlete training loads.3 The quantification of external training load for overhead throwing athletes has lagged behind other sports, often relying on crude metrics such as pitch counts18 and balls bowled.14 We applaud Camp and colleagues5 for their efforts toward closing this gap, as the urgency of throwing stress and load monitoring is highlighted by Campâ€™s own research4 on the alarming trends in elbow injuries in professional baseball. The use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) has the potential to help practitioners better understand and monitor these stresses. Using such a device, Camp et al5 sought to determine the mechanical factors that have the greatest within-athlete association with elbow varus torque. The hypothesis tested was that arm slot would have a minimal effect on elbow varus torque; however, torque would likely increase as arm speed and arm rotation increase. We have a number of concerns about this publication that we believe require attention."
