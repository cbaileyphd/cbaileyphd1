abstract: "The purpose of this study was to examine the differences in reactive strength index-modified (RSImod), jump height (JH), and time to takeoff (TTT) between six U.S. collegiate sport teams. 106 male and female Division I collegiate athletes performed unloaded (< 1 kg) and loaded (20 kg) countermovement jumps as part of an ongoing athlete monitoring program. RSImod, JH, and TTT values for each team were compared using one-way ANOVAs. Statistically significant differences in RSImod (p < 0.001), JH (p < 0.001), and TTT (p = 0.003) existed between teams during the unloaded jumping condition. Similarly, statistically significant differences in RSImod (p < 0.001), JH (p < 0.001), and TTT (p = 0.028) existed between teams during the loaded jumping condition. Men’s soccer and baseball produced the greatest RSImod values during both the unloaded and loaded jumping conditions followed by women’s volleyball, men’s tennis, women’s soccer, and women’s tennis. The greatest JH during unloaded and loaded jumping conditions was produced by men’s baseball and followed by men’s soccer, women’s volleyball, men’s tennis, women’s soccer, and women’s tennis. Men’s soccer produced shorter TTT compared to men’s baseball (12.7%) and women’s soccer (13.3%) during the unloaded and loaded jumping conditions, respectively. Collegiate sport teams exhibit varying reactive strength characteristics during unloaded and loaded jumping conditions. Understanding differences in RSImod between sports may help direct the creation of training and monitoring programs more effectively for various sports.
