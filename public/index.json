There a lot of benefits to shedding the wires from our data collection equipment. But much like everything else, there are potential issues and pitfalls we may fall into if we aren’t careful. Hopefully our first steps without the strings are better than Pinnochio’s.\n giphy.com   Athlete Monitoring? Since it is the main focus of the first part of this write-up, it should probably be defined. The definition I like to use is:\n “Continual testing and evaluation of athletes (physically, phsyiologically, psychologically, etc.) throughout their careers (possibly beyond) as objectively as possible.”  A group of PhD students back in 2014, helping me prepare for an on-campus interview.   I think that definition works because it hits several key areas that help differentiate athlete monitoring from testing. The first word is continual, implying that it must be done more than once and hopefully on a regular basis. While I don’t think you absolutely have to monitor all the areas I mentioned, I think a well rounded monitoring program is very beneficial. Monitoring across a career is also important as we should seek to understand how individual athletes respond to training stimuli differently as they age. Finally, the word objective is in there. Whenever possible getting objective data works better than subjective data. Even if we ignore the potential error and learning effect associated with collecting subjective measures for the moment, objective data are still easier to work with for modelling and visualization purposes. Subjective measures have also come under fire lately for their predictive ability (Rodríguez-Marroyo, 2015) as well as athletes self-modulating work loads prior to reporting subjective measures thus influencing the ability of the practitioner to accurately quantify a workload (Sampson et al., 2019).\n What Athlete Monitoring is not… This means there is also something that is definitely not athlete monitoring. There are quite a few mistakes that will derail an athlete monitoring and sport science program if you are not careful.\nCollecting data and not knowing what to do with it, or never using it at all This is very common. This is also a great way to lose the interest of your coach and athletes. They are often interested in testing, but not when you collect data an report back on it several weeks later. Take a look at the image below.\nI created this as a way to understand the relationship between testing time and level of interest from a theoretical/experience based-perspective. Obviously, the quicker we can get the data back the better. We will likely get a Peter Griffinesque response if we come back to the coaches and athletes weeks after the test with the data. That being said, there is future value in the form of research and understanding the training response. Unfortunately that will be of little value to the coaches and athletes who want to win now.\n giphy.com   We are not turning athletes into research projects. Since it was just mentioned above, this seems like a good time to discuss this aspect. This does not mean that reasearch does not take place. In fact, it often does. But, that is not necessarily the primary goal. The primary goal should be sport performance driven in an athlete monitoring program. The research is often a by-product.\n Athlete monitoring is also not just pre/post season testing I’m happy that some are at least doing this, but this is not athlete monitoring. This leaves way too much time in between where something could go wrong that, if detected, might be repairable/preventable. If we don’t test agian until the end of the season, it’s too late. Take a look at the 2 plots below and come up with a quick conclusion. It’s the same data represent 2 different ways.\n cbaileyphd.com  \nWe should also consider the possibility that our single testing session was much better or much worse that the average testing session for a specific athlete. Looking at the plots above, that looks like an improvement. It’s not. Look at again when I include the other 10 data points between the first and final sessions you saw above. The slope of the line is essentially 0 with one outlier that happened to be on the final day of testing. Why was there an outlier? There could be quite a few reasons, but this is the only day they were allowed to sleep in. Lifting generally happened at 6:30 or 7:15 depending on position, but the final day didn’t start until late morning. This would be a great place for a tangent about standardizing data collection times, but I think you get the point without it.\n cbaileyphd.com  \n Extremely Fatiguing or Invasive So this should be pretty logical, but if we are testing something on a regular basis (i.e. weekly) in and out of season, it can’t be overly fatiguing. If fatigue or soreness from monitoring negatively impact a players on the field performance, we are missing the point. Depending on the level, someone might be losing their job.\nTesting also should not be overly invasive. Whenever possible, we should try to adapt to the sport and potentially monitor something that is already occuring. For example, during baseball batting practice, position players who are not in the hitting group on the field or in the cage often practice baserunning. This could easily be monitored (assuming they give a good effort). This is extremely beneficial in that you are not creating extra duties for the players or taking extra time. In professional sports time is money and collegiate sports are generally bound by NCAA hours, so we must be very efficient with athletes’ time.\nThese two things should heavily influence our test selection. Maximal effort jumps sound like a good choice, since they can be done quickly and they don’t cause excessive fatigue. Weekly 1RM squats or IMTPs on the other hand, not so much.\n Finally athlete monitoring should not be extremely time consuming for the S\u0026amp;C coach I’ll start this one off with a caveat. It will be time consuming, but you need to weigh the pros and cons. There is a reason many professional teams are hiring people to do this full-time. If you are one of those people, congrats. If you are an S\u0026amp;C coach who is dabbling in sport science to make you a better coach and help you offer better training to your athletes, congrats and keep it up. That being said, you do need to balance your time.\nSomething needs to be reevaluated if you are spending so much time in front of the computer that you don’t have time to coach your athletes. If you don’t have much experience with data analysis and coding, this will take some time, but it is no different than learning anything else or just working hard on something in general. You won’t learn it overnight and you never completely learn anything. There will always be a shiny new toy that you can pick up.\nDepending on your budget, you could buy software to do this for you. If that is the case, this likely won’t take up as much time and you won’t need any coding experience. But, you should have some knowledge of what is going on under the hood. Otherwise, you might not catch mistakes and bad data.\n  Why monitor? If you’ve read this far, I’m assuming you are willing to put in the work or have the budget to buy some software to collect and visualize your data. So you probably don’t need much selling on athlete monitoring, but you may need to sell someone who’s in charge of your budget. Here are some of the main reasons justifying athlete monitoring practices.\nIncreased ability to understand the overall training process (Sands, 1991) Hopefully our training sessions are prescribed with a set volume and intensity in mind. Here, we will consider each training session an indivitual “stimulus.” Each stimulus will produce a response. We often first learn this from Hans Selye’s General Adaptation Syndrome or an adaptation of it. Consider the figure below. We have a training stimulus that causes fatigue and some damage. We the provide recovery time and the fatigue dissipates and hopefully some adapation occurs that puts the athlete in a better position to perform than when they started. They essentially have a new level of preparedness or a “supercompensation.”\nLet’s imagine that we are training Goldilocks and this is the story of “Goldilocks and the Three Training Stimuli.” The figure above would be the final stimulus in the story that is “just right.” This is what we hope for when we prescribe training. In reality, we may be “too hot” or “too cold” sometimes and without monitoring, we may not know it.\nIn this case, too hot or too cold would be a training stimulus that is either too large or too small. Or it could be that the recovery time and/or nutrition was not optimal. The images below represent that. First is the training stimulus that is too small and it is followed by a larger stimulus.\nWe do not get the desired increase in level of preparedness with either of these scenarios. The first is too small and we don’t even return to the initial level with the second. The second could be by design if we are in a planned overreaching phase. If that is the case with proper recovery time and nutrition, we should see an even greater supercompensation.\nThe stimulus that is too large or lacks adequate recovery time becomes a problem when we additional similar stimuli are added on. This could lead to overtraining. It’s important to remember that our athletes also have workloads from practice and competition that should be considered in their training volume. We can design a great program with adequate stimulus size and recovery time, but it may not work if we are only considering what is happening in the weight room. This added volume can also lead less than optimal recovery and this fatigue will mask their ability to express fitness. An example of this can be seen in the figure below.\n Provides direct feedback of the athlete’s progress (or regress) to the coaching staff (Sands, 1991) Sport coaches are also in need of information on their athlete’s progression. Without the data, all they have to go on is what they see on the field. This will help validate your program as well. Imagine your team is having a bad year. Having data showing that the athletes are progressing in their physical development is quite valuable in times when their win/loss records don’t show it.\n Helps us determine the variables that may contribute to optimal performance (Talent ID) (Vaeyens et al., 2008) Hopefully a lot of the data we collect relates to actual sport performance. We train for specific adapations and those adapations should be specific to the sport. So if what we test assesses those qualities, the data should be somewhat predictive of performance. If we find that it is not, we may need to reevaluate our test. The figure below is an example of using data from an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and correlating it with ball exit velocity in baseball players. While this plot may look fancy (created with the R performanceanalytics package), it shows very little relationship with ball exit velocity. Bat speed at impact seems to be the only variable with predictive value here. All the other relationships are between the IMU collected variables.\nIf we have data that correlate strongly with specific sport performance measures, they may be used to identify better performing athletes. This may be helpful for those in your organization that are in charge of talent identification and scouting. This could also be used to classify athletes into groups. Certain positions may produce certain types of data and there may be justification here to evaluate them based off of their performance.\n Eusufzai \u0026amp; Bailey, 2019  \nAll this being said, we need to be careful of Goodhart’s Law here.\n “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure”  Marilyn Strathern   If we start training for the data, we may be missing the boat here. Training should be designed to enhance physical preparation. The data may be indicative of the preparation level, but the data does not cause it. This could also be looked at as an endogeneity or correlation/causation problem.\n Can help distinguish the factors associated with injury, overtraining, and athlete burnout (Hoffman and Kaminsky 2000, Foster 1998) I think this has already been covered in the “understanding the training process” point above, but it deserves its own heading. If we aren’t testing, we don’t know. We can evaluate this with decreases in performance measures as well as with subjective data (surveys, questionnaires, etc.). If we use subjective data, I prefer those that attach objective value to the responses, because it makes them easier to understand and interpret (e.g. session RPE). Some examples of variables that may be related to injury, overtraining, and athlete burnout are below.\n cbaileyphd.com  \n Can provide information about when it is safe for an athlete to return to competition (Johnston, 2014) Following an injury, an athlete goes through many tests to satisfy the physicians and athletic trainers that they are ready to return to play. These assessments can be used from a monitoring perspective as well to track progress and give a data-driven estimation of when the athlete will be able to get back on the field.\nIn a novel protocol, Brian Joshnston used bilateral force production and asymmetry to provide additional information for return to play for an athlete post-ACL reconstruction. His athlete passed many of the traditional retrun to play assessments but still failed on jump landings as evaluated with bilateral force plates.\nUsing this type of data from a monitoring perspective, we can see how an athlete changes over time and could make a better prediction of when an athlete can return.\n cbaileyphd.com  \n  Conclusion (for part 1) Athlete monitoring can be a valuable asset to your program. This is probably why many teams are now investing in sport science staff and infrastructure. There seems to be plenty of data justifying its inclusion in sports. But, there are plenty of ways to fall on our face while trying to incorporate it. Hopefully this information helped you and may prevent some of those issues.\nThis was the first part of a lecture dealing with these issues. Thanks for reading. Part 2 will deal more with the currently available wirless technology and some of the issues with it.\nReferences  Anagnost, NG, Lates, A, Taber, CB. (2018).

Like me, you probably pick assessments that have shown to be reliable and valid previously in research. But, you should also continuously evaluate your own reliability. If you are completing your own analysis and producing your own visualizations in R, you can build this into your code somewhat easily. Next we might evaluate our data for normality if we are going to perform any statistical analyses that depend on normality.\nOne place that is quite often missed in our initial data screening and analysis is something that heavily influences reliability and validity. It is probably more of an issue than many of us realize because it is so rarely evaluated. I am talking about heteroscedasticity (sometimes spelled with a k). Heteroscedasticity essentially means that the specific variable or key performance indicator (KPI) may vary unequally depending on the measure size. A realy high value may have more variation or the opposite could be true with low values. If we are not testing for this, we are essentially assuming homosecdasticity (equal variance regardless of measure magnitude). Since we deal with human performance data, we may often see extreme values (very high or very low) values on a regular basis. But, if are data are heteroscedastic, maybe we shouldn’t be too confident in the validity and reliability of that data. This post is going to be dealing with and detecting this issue. This can be tested for statistically fairly quickly with some R packages (for example, lmtest or gvlma) and probably with other statistical software as well, but I will show how to see it visually as well. Visualizing it likely helps us understand it further, even if it takes a little longer.\n The data We’ll start by reading in the data and calling on some specific packages that we will use. This data set is from 35 NCAA DIII baseball players who performed 2 maximal effort countermovement jump trials. This specific testing data was selected because it is the first of the year. This was the first time jumping off a force plate for probably all of the new players. If there was going to be an issue with reliability, one should expect it to be early on, with reliability increasing somewhat as athletes become more familiar with jump testing. This seems to be particularly true for the new athletes who aren’t used to jumping without an armswing.\nThe jump analysis has already been performed and a table was created to give us the mean of the trials for each variable as well as the individual trials. Names and body mass have been removed. The other variables include jump height (JH), peak power (PP), rate of force development (RFD), peak propulsive force (PF), and peak landing force (PLF). They are being rounded to 2 decimal places.\nlibrary(data.table) library(ggplot2) library(ggthemes) library(dplyr) p \u0026lt;- fread(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/BaseballCMJData.csv\u0026quot;) p\u0026lt;-select(p, -Athlete, -Mass) p\u0026lt;-round(p, 2) As discussed earlier, we should start by evaluating reliability. Here, I’ll look at relative reliability with ICCs.\nlibrary(ICC) ICCdf\u0026lt;-fread(\u0026quot;~/Desktop/BaseballCMJData1.csv\u0026quot;) ICCdf$Athlete\u0026lt;- as.factor(ICCdf$Athlete) JH\u0026lt;-ICCest(Athlete, JH, data = ICCdf, alpha = 0.05, CI.type = c(\u0026quot;THD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;)) PP\u0026lt;-ICCest(Athlete, PP, data = ICCdf, alpha = 0.05, CI.type = c(\u0026quot;THD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;)) RFD\u0026lt;-ICCest(Athlete, RFD, data = ICCdf, alpha = 0.05, CI.type = c(\u0026quot;THD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;)) PF\u0026lt;-ICCest(Athlete, PF, data = ICCdf, alpha = 0.05, CI.type = c(\u0026quot;THD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;)) PLF\u0026lt;-ICCest(Athlete, PLF, data = ICCdf, alpha = 0.05, CI.type = c(\u0026quot;THD\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Smith\u0026quot;)) ICCresults\u0026lt;-data.frame(JH=JH$ICC, PP=PP$ICC, RFD=RFD$ICC, PF=PF$ICC, PLF=PLF$ICC) ##Note that I am specifically only calling the ICC part of the ICCest values produced. As a result, I will not see the 95% confidcence intervals of those values. You should look at those, I am only doing that here because it takes up less screen space. ICCresults\u0026lt;-ICCresults %\u0026gt;% mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 3)) knitr::kable(ICCresults)   JH PP RFD PF PLF    0.771 0.9 0.845 0.913 0.633    Here we see that PLF is the least reliable variable (ICC = 0.633, [0.387 - 0.796]), but all the rest might be considered acceptable \u0026gt;0.7. You don’t see the 95%CI’s in the table because I excluded them to make it more readable. If you call the ICCest result of each variable, you would get the full information.\nNow we can look at absolute reliability measures, in this case, coefficients of variation (CV). The CV is just the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. It is multiplied by 100 to be represented as a percent. This can also be done with the sjstats package cv function as done below.\njhCV\u0026lt;-sjstats::cv(p$JH)*100 ppCV\u0026lt;-sjstats::cv(p$PP)*100 rfdCV\u0026lt;-sjstats::cv(p$RFD)*100 pfCV\u0026lt;-sjstats::cv(p$PF)*100 plfCV\u0026lt;-sjstats::cv(p$PLF)*100 CV\u0026lt;-data.frame(JH = jhCV, PP = ppCV, RFD = rfdCV, PF = pfCV, PLF = plfCV) CV\u0026lt;-round(CV,2) knitr::kable(CV)   JH PP RFD PF PLF    16.34 13.19 65.06 21.85 22.84    We would like the CVs to be lower than 15%, so we obviously have some violations here. But keep in mind this is the first day of a weekly monitoring protocol, so these values may decrease and become acceptable as time goes on. I would wait a few weeks before making a decision about throwing variables out.\n Heteroscedasticity First, lets add in the intraindividual differences between trials for each variable. We will use these to see if those who produce very large or very small values have the same chance to vary as those who do not.\np$JHdiff\u0026lt;-abs(p$JH1-p$JH2) p$PPdiff\u0026lt;-abs(p$PP1-p$PP2) p$RFDdiff\u0026lt;-abs(p$RFD1-p$RFD2) p$PFdiff\u0026lt;-abs(p$PF1-p$PF2) p$PLFdiff\u0026lt;-abs(p$PLF1-p$PLF2) head(p) ## JH JH1 JH2 PP PP1 PP2 RFD RFD1 RFD2 PF ## 1: 33.80 33.41 34.19 4095.96 4078.19 4113.72 2769.87 2072.99 3466.74 2043.99 ## 2: 37.57 38.59 36.56 5056.99 5123.89 4990.09 12230.43 8051.97 16408.89 2928.29 ## 3: 30.11 30.53 29.68 4186.75 4216.04 4157.45 2557.01 2851.88 2262.15 2035.20 ## 4: 36.45 34.32 38.59 3934.84 3809.79 4059.88 2253.66 2165.22 2342.10 1826.65 ## 5: 31.29 32.78 29.80 4164.87 4260.65 4069.09 4124.39 3483.75 4765.04 2533.76 ## 6: 27.32 27.67 26.97 3415.35 3436.63 3394.07 10571.72 10996.40 10147.04 2747.53 ## PF1 PF2 PLF PLF1 PLF2 JHdiff PPdiff RFDdiff PFdiff PLFdiff ## 1: 1924.08 2163.89 7922.00 8473.38 7370.61 0.78 35.53 1393.75 239.81 1102.77 ## 2: 2750.66 3105.91 7053.33 6797.44 7309.22 2.03 133.80 8356.92 355.25 511.78 ## 3: 2105.46 1964.95 6341.77 6689.75 5993.79 0.85 58.59 589.73 140.51 695.96 ## 4: 1794.86 1858.44 6139.69 6705.91 5573.46 4.27 250.09 176.88 63.58 1132.45 ## 5: 2368.84 2698.67 5819.41 5814.65 5824.17 2.98 191.56 1281.29 329.83 9.52 ## 6: 2770.85 2724.20 4203.07 3730.65 4675.48 0.70 42.56 849.36 46.65 944.83 Start visually Let’s visually evaluate for the presence of heteroscedasticity by plotting the individual differences against the means. This is essentially creating a linear model where the measure variance (i.e. JHdiff) is being predicted by the measure magnitude (mean of the variable trials). If the data are homoscedastic (equal chance of variablity no matter what the measure magnitude is), then the data that aren’t clustered around the linear model should not have any trend. If the data are heteroscedastic, then a trend may be visible (more variance at either high or low values). If you were to draw an outline of all the data points and the shape is a rectangle, then the data are likely homoscedastic. If the shape resembles more of a triangle/funnel with the data close to the line at one side and more spread out along the other, then the data are likely heteroscedastic. Let’s take a look.\nggplot(p, aes(JH,JHdiff))+geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=\u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Jump Height (cm)\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Residuals\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;JH means\u0026quot;) Using geom_encircle from the ggalt package, I may be able to better display what I mean by outlining the data and its shape. This step likely is not necessaary once the point is understood.\nlibrary(ggalt) ggplot(p, aes(JH,JHdiff))+geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=\u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Jump Height (cm)\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Residuals\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;JH means\u0026quot;) + geom_encircle() In this way we can see how the shape is more broad toward the higher jump height values. This is also a good opportunity to see how a couple of data points (in the top right) might be able skew our interpretation. But there are still quite a few others that deviate from the model below that as well. This may visually indicate that jump height is heteroscedastic, but statistical evidence is necessary to confirm this.\nLet’s do the same thing with another variable (peak power).\nggplot(p, aes(PP,PPdiff))+geom_point()+ geom_smooth(method=\u0026#39;lm\u0026#39;) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Peak Power (watts)\u0026quot;) + ylab(\u0026quot;Residuals\u0026quot;) + xlab(\u0026quot;PP means\u0026quot;) + geom_encircle() Here we can see that the shape is more rectangular. There are a few points deviating from the model, but not necessarily trended toward either end. This should visually indicate that peak power in this sample is homoscedastic.\nNow let’s look at all the data plotted.\ngridExtra::grid.arrange(JH, PP, RFD, PF, PLF) Looking at the plots, we can definitely see that there are some data points that deviate away from the models. Specifically looking at peak landing force, there may be a noticeable trend in that those that land with the highest forces also have the most measurement variaability.\n  Add in some statistics Now let’s add some statistical evidince with a Breusch-Pagan test from the lmtest package. We’ll start with jump height. We first need to create a linear model predicting the measure variance by the measure magnitude, similar to the plots above.\nlibrary(lmtest) ##Create the model JHm\u0026lt;-lm(p$JHdiff~p$JH) ##run the Breusch-Pagan test on the model bptest(JHm) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: JHm ## BP = 8.8708, df = 1, p-value = 0.002898 That statistically significant value of 0.002898 (\u0026lt;0.01) indicates that we do have heteroscedasticity in JH. We are rejecting the null hypothesis that heteroscedasticity is not present. This is a decent sample size with 35 baseball players, but it looks like we have a couple of data points that may be skewing the results as noted earlier. Give it a few weeks and this may go away. That being said, this could be an actual issue given the other points deviating from the model. A larger sample would help to either confirm or reject this notion.\nIt’s also worth noting that there is an easier way to plot the linear model than was done above. It’s not quite as pretty, but it’s faster if you’ve already created the model. Once the model has been created plot(modelname) will produce several plots of the model. The first plot shows the residual values plotted against the fitted model pretty much identically to the ones above.\npar(mfrow=c(2,2)) plot(JHm) We can also check to see how great our model is (predicting the amount of variablity in JH by the measure magnitude).\nsummary(JHm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = p$JHdiff ~ p$JH) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -3.8702 -1.7817 -0.4153 0.6675 8.9286 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

It only has an adjusted-R squared of 0.165, so we can predict 16.5% of the variance’s variance by the measure magnitude alone.\nLet’s look at the rest of the BPtest results. Here’s peak power.\nlibrary(lmtest) PPm\u0026lt;-lm(p$PPdiff~p$PP) bptest(PPm) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: PPm ## BP = 2.1369, df = 1, p-value = 0.1438 RFD\nlibrary(lmtest) RFDm\u0026lt;-lm(p$RFDdiff~p$RFD) bptest(RFDm) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: RFDm ## BP = 3.9686, df = 1, p-value = 0.04636 We are close with RFD, or we may have evidence of heteroscedasticity depending on the critical value you chose (p\u0026lt;0.01 or p\u0026lt;0.05)\nPF\nlibrary(lmtest) PFm\u0026lt;-lm(p$PFdiff~p$PF) bptest(PFm) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: PFm ## BP = 3.6578, df = 1, p-value = 0.05581 and finally peak landing force (PLF)\nlibrary(lmtest) PLFm\u0026lt;-lm(p$PLFdiff~p$PLF) bptest(PLFm) ## ## studentized Breusch-Pagan test ## ## data: PLFm ## BP = 7.9904, df = 1, p-value = 0.004703 It is interesting that we do contain heteroscedasticity in PLF. Given landing force’s generally unreliable nature, I would have assumed the chance to vary was the same (very high) no matter the magnitude. This may also be influenced by the usage of an instantaneous measure as opposed to something like impulse or RFD. Let’s check to see how great of a model this one is.\nsummary(PLFm) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = p$PLFdiff ~ p$PLF) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1118.10 -441.17 -20.17 390.32 1689.70 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

We may have evidence that elite performers or poor performers may have a better chance at producing errors. If elite athletes (who produce data towards the extremes on normal data distributions) have a greater chance to produce errors, we may be making decisions based on bad data.  Evaluation of data for heteroscedasticity is likely more important in performance monitoring of high level athletes.  Data transformation may reduce the presence of heteroscedasticity, but may not be practical if the resulting values are not logical.   giphy.com   follow me on Twitter   personal website  \n ","date":1552089600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552089600,"objectID":"2378b912f7d2c448848c3a39b4a93951","permalink":"/post/variability-and-measure-magnitude-in-performance-data/","publishdate":"2019-03-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/variability-and-measure-magnitude-in-performance-data/","section":"post","summary":"Getting started with monitoring data Initially, we shoud be primarily concerned with reliability.

The quantitative section may be seemingly straightforward, with higher values being better, but they are often compared to and normalized to other courses that are completely different from yours. But at least they are objective. I usually struggle the most with the comments section. They always seem to be equal parts encouraging, frustrating, and contradicting. Encouraging comments usually provide some affirmation of my teaching methods, frustrating ones usually provide the opposite or say that my course is boring, and then I usually get a few comments that make no sense or contradict themselves. An example of each from this semester is below.\nEncouraging examples:  “I enjoyed the lab work. This helped explain the aspects taught in the class and allowed students to see and feel the results themselves.”  I have a very similar statement in my syllabus as to why we do in class activities. I try to focus on applied learning and we have a lot of in class activities.  “he made you feel like you’re the one doing the lab tests even if it was just in the classroom. He was very interactive towards the students”   Discouraging example:  “very little class interaction during lecture”  I try to have an in class activity during every lecture that reinforces what we are discussing and hopefully encourages interaction. I walk around from group to group discussing the assignment and hopefully get a feel for how students are grasping the concepts. So this comment is frustrating.    Contradicting example:  “This class was much more difficult than anticipated. I was intending for it to be my”leisure class\" as my course load this semester is rather intense, but that was not the case.\"  This was for a senior level course called “Quantitative Analysis.”    The problem It is very easy for me to only consider specific comments and forget all the other ones. This could be due to confirmation bias after reading a good comment or my frustration over a bad comment. Either way, it is difficult to get an overall course summary on what I did well and what needs to change from open ended statements.\n A Data Science based solution: Text Mining I recently learned about text mining and sentiment analysis in R and I’ve been looking for a real world opportunity to use it. Actually that was only part of my motivation for this. After seeing the word “boring” multiple times in my Quantitative Analysis course comments, I thought it would be funny if I made a wordcloud and that was one of the biggest words (meaning it was one of the most commonly appearing words). I thought I could frame the results and use it as motivation for future course development.\nThis is actually quite easy to do in R. Much like analyzing other data in R, you need to be able to read it in a format that is tab or comma delimited. I did this by copying and pasting all my comments into a text editor (Sublime Text) and saving it as a .txt file. After that everything was completed in R. I will share the results here, with my code imbedded in case you want to do this for your own courses or for some other application.\nwordcloud I’ll show the finished product first. As you can see “boring” wasn’t one of the most used word. Many of the words are consistent with my teaching style. I try to focus on applied learning with labs and in class activities, so those words appear a lot. Other words appear that likely should have been filtered out since they are part of the course name. In this course, Exercise Testing and Prescription, the title likely results in the words “exercise” and “testing” usage frequency being inflated. My name probably should have been filtered out also.\n##How the sauce is made Let’s take a look at how this is done and we can dive a little deeper as well. For this project we will need the tm and wordcloud2 packages.\nlibrary(tm) ## Loading required package: NLP library(wordcloud2) Now we need to read our data in.\nEXRX_cloud\u0026lt;-readLines(\u0026quot;KINE4320.txt\u0026quot;) Now this needs to be converted to a corpus so that it can be manipulated.\nEXRX_corpus\u0026lt;-Corpus(VectorSource(EXRX_cloud)) At this stage it would be a good idea to inspect() your corpus to make sure everything shows up correctly, but I am not going to do that here as it would be a lot of lines.\nCurrently, my corpus is set up is with line numbers, lots of punctuation (sometimes not), capitalized letters, and some other things that won’t work well for a wordcloud. So we will clean that up in the next few steps with the map function in the tm package.\n##convert everythhing to lowercase EXRX_clean_corpus \u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_corpus,tolower) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_corpus, tolower): transformation drops ## documents ##remove the comment numbers. You should also notice that I am now using EXRX_clean_corpus inside of the map function and will be from now on. EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeNumbers) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeNumbers): transformation ## drops documents ##remove the punctuation EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, removePunctuation) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_clean_corpus, removePunctuation): ## transformation drops documents ##Get rid of extra spaces EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, stripWhitespace) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_clean_corpus, stripWhitespace): ## transformation drops documents ##remove stop words (the, that, etc.) EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeWords, stopwords()) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeWords, stopwords()): ## transformation drops documents ##I am commenting out the next line of code, because I do not want to stem the document, but that is a common practice when creating a wordcloud. What stemming will do is shortening words to their roots and then combining all of those. From experience doing this, it doesn\u0026#39;t work well in this scenario. For example \u0026#39;statistics\u0026#39; becomes \u0026#39;statist\u0026#39; and those are very different things. So if you want to do that, here\u0026#39;s how you would. ##EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;- tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, stemDocument) #Lastly, there are some words that aren\u0026#39;t necessarily stop words, but I don\u0026#39;t want them being counted. So I am factoring those out here. EXRX_clean_corpus\u0026lt;-tm_map(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeWords, c(\u0026quot;class\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;yes\u0026quot;)) ## Warning in tm_map.SimpleCorpus(EXRX_clean_corpus, removeWords, c(\u0026quot;class\u0026quot;, : ## transformation drops documents This is another point were you should use the tm inspect function to check your work. Again, I’m not going to do it here because it will take up a lot of space. But you should inspect(EXRX_clean_corpus).\nNow we can create the wordcloud. I am using the wordcloud2 package that will create this as html, but the wordcloud package will also work.\n##turn the corpus we\u0026#39;ve been working with into a term document matrix tdm \u0026lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(EXRX_clean_corpus) l \u0026lt;- as.matrix(tdm) ##sort it and make it a data frame x \u0026lt;- sort(rowSums(l),decreasing=TRUE) p \u0026lt;- data.frame(word = names(x),freq=x) #check it out head(p) ## word freq ## labs labs 14 ## concepts concepts 11 ## students students 11 ## nothing nothing 11 ## testing testing 10 ## learning learning 9 Now we can see the frequency of words used.\nLet’s make the actual wordcloud. It’s simple from this point. Since it is .html instead of a .png or .jpg, you can hover over each word to get the frequency of use.\nwordcloud2(p)

The size of the words are representative of the amount of times they were used. This should sound familiar to a bar plot from a visualization standpoint. A bar plot may not be as visually appealing, and it won’t be able to display near as many words, but it’s arguably easier to interpret.\nbarplot(p[1:10,]$freq, las = 2, names.arg = p[1:10,]$word, col =\u0026quot;springgreen\u0026quot;, main =\u0026quot;Most frequent words\u0026quot;, ylab = \u0026quot;Word frequencies\u0026quot;) Most of this makes since. I focus a lot on applied learning in this class so they do a lot of “in class actvities” and labs. I probably should have filtered out the words “nothing” and “detracted” since they are responding to a question about what detracted from their learning at one point. Many of those answers were “nothing.”\nThe last bit of exploratory analysis that I will do is correlation. I will specifically look for the words that are most correlated with these words that appear the most and I will set a limit of 0.3 (low end of moderate r value), so that I only see words that correlate higher than that. I will start with the word “labs,” since it is the most commonly used word.\nfindAssocs(tdm, terms = \u0026quot;labs\u0026quot;, corlimit = 0.3) ## $labs ## hands excited love matter missed personal since thats ## 0.60 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 0.50 ## one ## 0.34 Looking at the results, this mostly makes sense. I’m assuming “hands” was part of “hands on” before the corpus was cleaned. The words “excited” and “love” being associated with “labs” is probably a good thing. But the word “missed” being associated at the same value (r = 0.50) means that at least a few people made comments about missing labs.\nFor me, this is a much more objective way to interpret my evaluations with the added benefit of removing any potential bias I may have when I just read through the comments. This only really works with large classes and if you have a high response rate on your evaluations. If you have a small class size or a small number of responses, this really isn’t necessary.\n ","date":1545264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545264000,"objectID":"3d7a7ae6dc7b9a5ff5e57f85e2eca86c","permalink":"/post/making-sense-of-student-evaluations-a-data-science-text-mining-approach/","publishdate":"2018-12-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/making-sense-of-student-evaluations-a-data-science-text-mining-approach/","section":"post","summary":"After every semester I find myself in the same situation, reading through student evaluations and comments trying to find some value in them.

By that I mean that only the force production necessary for this movement are present in the data. There is no blank space or data with the athletes simply standing on the force plate. As a result of that, the analysis is much easier, but the force values of each force plate cannot be summed since the time has been altered (trimmed at the beginning or the end). Each athlete in this data set completed 3 trials and I’ve removed the name of one of them so it can be used as an example here.\nRead your data in First we need to read in the file. You can name assign it whatever name you want. I always pick something short.\nF1\u0026lt;-read.csv(\u0026quot;Player1.csv\u0026quot;) Next, since these force plates are biaxial (vertical (GRFz) and mediolateral (GRFx) in this case), I want to get the resultant force produced. I’ll do that with Pythagorean theorem and assign it to a variable name for each trial and each leg (drive leg (DL) and stride leg (SL).\n Get the resultant forces F1$DLRes1\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzDL1^2 + F1$GRFxDL1^2) F1$SLRes1\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzSL1^2 + F1$GRFxSL1^2) F1$DLRes2\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzDL2^2 + F1$GRFxDL2^2) F1$SLRes2\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzSL2^2 + F1$GRFxSL2^2) F1$DLRes3\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzDL3^2 + F1$GRFxDL3^2) F1$SLRes3\u0026lt;-sqrt(F1$GRFzSL3^2 + F1$GRFxSL3^2)  Calculating the variables of interest Now lets get to performing the analysis. Caluclating peak force (PPF) is fairly simple. We will also calclate the time when it occurs (PFt), which we will need for the RFD calculation later. This is also fairly simple in that we are asking for the time which the resultant force is equal to the varialbe we just assigned to PPF or peak force. The only trick here is the addition of the [1]-1 at the end. The reason that is there is so that we pull the first occurence of this event. If the same exact value appears more than once, your code will throw an error. This does happen sometimes with consecutive values when you sample at high rates. Adding this in will prevent those issues.\nPF \u0026lt;- max(F1$DLRes1, na.rm = TRUE) print(PF) ## [1] 894.4183 PFt \u0026lt;- F1$Time1[which(F1$DLRes1==PF)[1]-1]  Now let’s work on RFD. This will be calculated as the slope of the line from the initial force produced to the peak force. So this will be rise over run (change in force/change in time). Meaning we will need to calculate those first. We will start with the initial force produced (FInit) and the time at which it is produced (FInitT). Here we are simply calling for the first value and then for the time which that force value occurs.\nFInit\u0026lt;- F1$DLRes1[1] FInitT \u0026lt;- F1$Time1[which(F1$DLRes1==FInit)] We already have the time which PF occurs, so now we just need to calculate the chage in Force and the change in time and divide them. Again, we’ll print RFD to check it.\nchangeT \u0026lt;- PFt + FInitT changeF \u0026lt;- PF - FInit RFD \u0026lt;- changeF/changeT print(RFD) ## [1] 1463.233 To calculate impulse, we will need the minimum values (force and time) which occur at the end of the drive leg f/t curve when the weight shift occurs.

In order to calculate it, we will need several arguments including: what are the x and y values, from what point to what point do we want to calculate the area for and the type. Force-time curves are almost always set up with time on the x axis and force on the y axis, so that gives us the information for the first part.

If you are willing to learn and put in the effort, you can design your own force-time curve analysis programs in R or python and avoid the budget hit. Matt Sams created an [open source vertical jump analysis project] (https://www.researchgate.net/project/Open-source-vertical-jump-analysis-script) for this purpose, coded in R with a shiny app.\nJump monitoring is quite popular due to its quick and easy of collection that doesn’t cause excessive fatigue, but also due to its relationship with other performance variables (Carlock, 2004, Kale, 2009, Shalfawi, 2011, Stone, 2004). These relationships can be evaluated by Pearson’s r values and seen in scatter plots, but the similarities can also be seen by visual inspection of the force-time curve characteristics. Check out the images below of squat jump and snatch (from the knee) force-time curves plotted in R from a single Bertec 6040 force plate collecting at 1000 Hz.\nIf the snatch f/t curve wasn’t labeled, you might confuse if for a jump. To be clear these are not normalized for time, they just look that similar. If snatch was coming from the floor, it would look very similar to a CMJ with the countermovement added. It’s no surprise that we can find lots of statistical and practical relationships between weightlifting and jumping performance.\n Collecting the Data Getting on to the topic at hand and title of this post, while at LaGrange College, we collected jumps on a weekly basis for nearly 2 years with our baseball team. I was collecting these because baseball is a “strength/power” sport and vertical jumping ability is usually a good marker of power, but specific performance decreases may also be indicative of accumulated fatigue, giving it added utility for athlete monitoring. While considering the relationship between hitting performance and jumping ability, I realized that I didn’t really know what a bat swing f/t curve looked like. When I looked at studies on hitting vGRF, they don’t publish images of the f/t curves. So, I decided to make one. Actually, I planned a larger study along with it looking at asymmetry and ball exit velocity, but this is how it started.\nAt LaGrange we had a few force plates, and the portable biaxial PASCOs would worked best for this set up (model 2142). They sample up to 1000 Hz, you can move them around and building a platform around them like a batter’s box was fairly easy (an image and a gif of the setup below). In order to control for the variation of reacting to pitch location, they hit off of a tee and self-selected its height. The back leg (drive leg) force plate was stationary, but the platform was made so that the stride leg force plate could be adjusted for stride length and location (changes in x,y).\nBat Swing Force-Time Curve Without further ado, the resulting force-time curve from the two force plates is below. On its own, the stride leg force-time curve looks similar to a jump, but the force magnitudes are lower. Keep in mind that the magnitude should be close to half the value, since we are dividing it over 2 force plates. That being said, at some point a weight shift will occur (DeRenne, 1993, Gola \u0026amp; Monteleone, 2001, Fortenbaugh et al., 2011, Mattingly \u0026amp; Rosenthal, 2007), which will result in similar force production values on a single force plate. With the weight shift in mind, it makes more sense to relate the drive leg to the propulsive phase of a jump and the stride leg braking phase to the landing phase of a jump.\n#### GRF Analysis in R If you are interested in how the GRF data were analyzed, you can find my code in part 2 of this post. The data were collected with PASCO’s Capstone software and files were exported as csv. Analysis took place in R to derive peak force, rate of force development (RFD), and impulse.\n  Reliability Much like any other performance data that we monitor, reliability should be evaluated. Looking at the relative reliability in the form of the intraclass correlation [3,1] (with 95% confidence intervals), it’s not too bad. Depending on the reference you use, you might say all are acceptable values. But there is a noticeable trend that the stride leg values are less reliable than the drive leg values. Going back to an earlier comment on the similarities between the stride leg braking phase and the landing phase of a jump, this reliability finding is also consistent. Well, jump landings may be less reliable than the stride leg braking phase, but the trend is the same.\nknitr::kable(ICC)   Var ICC    DL PF 0.952 [0.888 - 0.383]  SL PF 0.725 [0.474 - 0.891]  DL RFD 0.685 [0.399 - 0.874]  SL RFD 0.773 [0.550 - 0.912]  DL Imp 0.904 [0.787 - 0.965]  SL Imp 0.756 [0.522 - 0.904]    Looking at our absolute measures of reliability (coefficient of variation), we see that RFD is not so reliable. Again, this is similar to jump data.\nknitr::kable(CV)   Var CV    DL PF 11.81%  SL PF 12.6%  DL RFD 37.77%  SL RFD 44.88%  DL Imp 12.36%  SL Imp 14.67%    Based on these findings, it may be worthwhile to collect data on peak force and impulse from a monitoring standpoint. But we should probably stay away from RFD and question the data we have from the the stride leg. While the stride leg reliability wasn’t terrible here, it was noticeably worse than the drive leg. Much like jump landings, poor reliability could kill our data or lead us to making an incorrect decision. We should regularly evaluate reliability at a minimum. Checking once and assuming it stays the same may not be acceptable in this case.\n References  Carlock, J.M., Smith, S.L., Hartman, M.J., Morris, R.T., Ciroslan, D.A., Pierce, K.C.,…(2004).
